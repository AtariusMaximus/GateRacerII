Gate Racer puts you in control of a high speed race car in a fierce time competition to post the fastest time without crashing your car into the side of the road or into a barrier on the road way.  Use your finely tuned driving skills to expertly navigate the random gates that are placed on the road course.  The car’s inertia will pull you to the sides of the road, so perfect timing and lots of practice are required to gain the skills needed to be a top driver.

In the never ending battle for the fastest track time, the scores of drivers that failed and crashed have created many oil slicks on the road. Do your best to avoid them or risk skidding out of control.

If you’re lucky, you’ll come across a booster pack that allows you to drive through and knock down the road barriers for a short amount of time with no damage to your car.  They are randomly placed throughout the road course.  Try for them at your own risk, they are often placed in an area that will cause a crash if you miss!

The object of the game is to survive on the road as long as you can. There is a timer at the bottom of the screen that records your time on the road.  Gate Racer II includes support for high score saving on the AtariVox and SaveKey.  After crashing, when you press the button to restart the game your score will be saved if it is higher than the current saved high score.  Your high score will then be displayed on the Title Screen the next time your power on or reset the game.
