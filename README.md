Gate Racer puts you in control of a high speed race car in a fierce time competition to post the fastest time without crashing your car into the side of the road or into a barrier on the road way.  Use your finely tuned driving skills to expertly navigate the random gates that are placed on the road course.  The car’s inertia will pull you to the sides of the road, so perfect timing and lots of practice are required to gain the skills needed to be a top driver.

In the never ending battle for the fastest track time, the scores of drivers that failed and crashed have created many oil slicks on the road. Do your best to avoid them or risk skidding out of control.

If you’re lucky, you’ll come across a booster pack that allows you to drive through and knock down the road barriers for a short amount of time with no damage to your car.  They are randomly placed throughout the road course.  Try for them at your own risk, they are often placed in an area that will cause a crash if you miss!

The object of the game is to survive on the road as long as you can. There is a timer at the bottom of the screen that records your time on the road.  Gate Racer II includes support for high score saving on the AtariVox and SaveKey.  After crashing, when you press the button to restart the game your score will be saved if it is higher than the current saved high score.  Your high score will then be displayed on the Title Screen the next time your power on or reset the game.

Above is the road couse you’ll see when playing the game. At the top is the gate that you must pass through. It’s location changes randomly as the gates scroll. The white block is the booster pack, the grey sprite is the oil slick, your car is near the bottom, and your time is recorded with the timer at the bottom of the screen.

Above is the opening title screen for Gate Racer II. After you’ve played through the game once with an AtariVox or SaveKey plugged in, your high score will be displayed here.  It will be all zero’s if no high score has been recorded or if there is no AtariVox or SaveKey currently plugged in.

Game Options.  Game options are available to select after pressing fire on the title screen.  Push the joystick right to scroll through the four options, push up and down on the joystick to change the option, and press fire to start the game.

Velocity (On or Off):  The default option is On, which adds inertia to your car when you drive left and right.  Turning this option off will immediately stop your car when you stop pushing on the joystick.

Oil Slick (On or Off):  The default option is On.  The oil slick will randomly scroll down the screen causing your car to skid back and forth when you run over it.  Turning this option off will cause oil slicks to never appear on the roadway.

Size of Car (Normal or Big):  The default option is Normal.  The default size of the car is a typical race car as designed for the road course. The larger car is available for a more challenging race.

Powerup (On or Off):  The default option is on.  The booster pack powerup will give you temporary invicibility on the road course, allowing you to knock down the barriers and drive right through them. This option may be turned off for a more challenging race.

Tips from the Developer.  Here are some tips to get you on the road to becoming an expert Gate Racer.

1. On wide turns, start turning the other direction before you've completely traveled through the gate.
2. Try and center yourself after every gate pass right away to make it easier to get to the next.
3. Trying to grab a booster pack that looks hard to reach is extremely risky.  Weigh your options carefully before gunning for one.
4. If it looks like you're going to have to drive right through an oil slick at the same time as passing through the gate, try to enter it dead-center. It won't swing you wide enough to hit the side of the gate.
